# Distribution

Distribution refers to the process of transporting a drug from its point of entry into the bloodstream to its target organs, tissues, or specific sites where it exerts its therapeutic effects, with factors such as drug properties and physiological characteristics influencing this process.

## BBB

It is a probability of expected blood to brain ratio of compound to be less than 0.1. The low ratio represents not efficient distribution which is frequently happens to massive structures.

The BBB dataset combines data from three sources, totaling 27,796 compounds, with 8,508 classified as BBB+ and 19,288 as BBB-. This dataset provides valuable insights into blood-brain barrier penetration.
