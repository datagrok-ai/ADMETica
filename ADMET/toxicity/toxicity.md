## LD50

Acute toxicity LD50 measures the most conservative dose that can lead to lethal adverse effects. The higher the dose, the more lethal of a drug.

| Name | Size | MAE | RMSE | R2 | Spearman |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| LD50 | 7282 | 0.437 | 0.609 | 0.596 | 0.745 |

## hERG

Inhibition of the hERG (human Ether-Ã -go-go-Related Gene) current causes QT interval prolongation and lead to life threatening arrhythmia. Inhibition of hERG is considered as precaution.

| Name | Size | Specificity | Sensitivity | Accuracy | Balanced Accuracy |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| hERG | 22,249 | 0.811 | 0.897 | 0.885 |  0.854  |
