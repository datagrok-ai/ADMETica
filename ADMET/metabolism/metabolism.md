# Metabolism

Metabolism is the intricate biochemical system responsible for managing energy and molecular processes within living organisms. It consists of two essential components: anabolism, where complex molecules are built, requiring energy like an investment, and catabolism, which breaks down substances to release energy, akin to a controlled chemical breakdown. This highly regulated process is influenced by various factors such as genetics, age, and lifestyle choices, impacting energy utilization, growth, repair, and overall vitality in a formal and simplified overview.
